Q2:
    If the gaussian kernel isn't shifted when the image is presented, four images will appear,
    each one is a quarter of the original image.
    The cause for this phenomenon is that the gaussian kernel isn't centralized around the coordination (0,0).
    This will cause pointwise multiplication of the fourier image with the  a wrong pixels.
