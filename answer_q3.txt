Q3:
    The results of the blurring filters are the same because of the convolution theorem.
    The theorem states that the convolution between f and g
    is equal to the pointwise multiplication of the F and G (which are the fourier representation of f and g).
    After the pointwise multiplication we perform IDFT on the result.
