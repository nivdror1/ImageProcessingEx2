Q1:
    On one hand, the derivation in the image space is only an approximation of the true derivative, we use this approximation
    because the image space is discrete. On the other hand, the derivation using the frequency space is the true derivative
    since the frequency space is continuous. Therefore the two magnitudes are different by a little bit.
